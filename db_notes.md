## Schema
- To view the database scheme from the terminal, initiate the MySQL command line, 
by typing:     `mysql -u root -p`    in your command line, then add your MySQL password when prompted.

- Check the database and tables were created by running in the MySQL command line,
* mysql> `USE just_tech_news_db; show tables; describe comment; describe post; describe user;describe vote;`
- You should see this result
- ![showtables](./img/<insert>.jpg "Show tables")

- Check the tables after seeding by running in the mysql command line, sample tables
* mysql> `select * from comment; select * from user; select * from post;select * from vote;`
- You should see this result
- ![selecttables](./img/<insert>.jpg "Select tables")
